		<p style="font-size: 1.8vmax; text-align: left; margin-left: 2%; margin-top:0; margin-right: 2%; color: #000535; font-family: Unna;">⠀⠀⠀⠀My name is Will Carlson, I am currently a senior in a Communications Major at the University of Connecticut. I am currently on track to graduate earn my Bachelor's Degree in May 2021. Previosuly, I was a Computer Science major, which gave me proficiency with the Python, Scheme, and C programming languages. However, I've mainly been focusing on getting an education in Visual Design both in class and outside of class.
		<br>
		<br>⠀⠀⠀⠀I've been using programs like Blender and Gimp since I was in early high school in order to try to express ideas and feelings that are hard to express with words. In addition to these programs, I have experience with Adobe Photoshop, Premiere, and Lightroom. Although I currently have no professional experience, I have spent many years designing social media, shirts, and posters for friends and clubs on campus. My main process for these designs is taking what the client explicitly requests and digging deeper in order to mix in the feel and emotion that props up the project.</p>

		<br>⠀⠀⠀⠀For this project, I pretty much just followed the directions, with a few changes here and there. I didn't have all of the same brushes so I just used the ones I had. I used the mesh tool on the elephant, and I used gradients on the flower petals to make them look more interesting. I used the paintbrush on the top with a rough texture and I used the symbol spray in the background using a second layer.

		<br>⠀⠀⠀⠀I started with the background color of the tiles, which decided what colors I would use in gradients and on the drawings. I made all of the different boxes in a separate file so that if illustrator crashed not much would be lost. The theme of the piece goes from the outer corners into the center, which plays out on multiple levels. For the background, the colors get brighter as they go to the center. For the content of the boxes, the different levels alternate between hand drawings and vector drawings. Finally, I wanted the theme to reflect someone's life as they fall into mental illness.

		<br>⠀⠀⠀⠀For this poster, I decided to keep the text minimal and have the visuals be high contrast. The first choice I made was having the title text and website be large and in opposite corners. The goal with this was to have the reader see these elements immediately and then fill in the rest of the poster. I split the poster into quadrants and then subdivided those as needed in order to decide where to put the rest of the elements. I used a photo of a flash drive as the main visual element, which I copied three times with increasing grain on each paste. I also put a barcode under the title, which I made using a 1-pixel tall noise render stretched out to 376 pixels. For the bottom half, I made a mock-up of an apple internet browser but upside down so that it looks more interesting. This is where I put the body text, and I put them on opposite corners to bridge the connection between the top left and bottom right portions. At the bottom, I put arrows pointing to the website to make the viewer look at it one last time.

		<br>⠀⠀⠀⠀This picture was from my mother's college graduation. The photo was sun-bleached from being in a frame, as well as torn in the bottom left corner. I started by using the content-aware fill tool in order to repair the corner, with some adjustments so that it would only sample the gowns. Next, I increased the contrast so that the photo was less washed out. I then used the vibrance adjustment to give the photo more color. At this point, the main issue was the left side of the photo is much lighter than the right side. I added another brightness/contrast layer and used a layer mask to bring the left side in line with the right side. After another small brightness adjustment, I decided to tackle the issue of sun damage in the middle of the picture. This is most apparent on the gowns, where the normal black color has turned blue. I added a hue/saturation adjustment layer and used a layer mask to darken this section. The other bleached part was in the trees, where I used a similar technique to return the leaves to green from their previous blue form. The final touch was ironing out some overexposed areas by using a completely black layer and layer mask. I used a brush with low opacity to make the fine adjustments.

		<br>⠀⠀⠀⠀In this composition, I used the color scheme and industrialism themes from a previous assignment to create a skyline, which I placed at the top of the image upside down. Inspired by the geometric reflections gallery, I decided to incorporate a reflection of the city inside of a circle. When I first did this, the copied image didn't carry over the gradient map, but I decided to use this to my advantage and used a vibrance adjustment to make the colors more pronounced. After this, I filled in the rest of the circle blue to simulate the sky behind the copied city. In the layer mask of the sky, I used a gradient to make it blend into the brown of the original city's sky. In addition to this, I used a gradient on the brown sky to make it fade to black and match the background. I then added a simple border, which I tried to make look like the border on a movie poster or a broadway show poster. After this, I added the text and placed it between the city and the border. Finally, I added a gradient over everything and set the blending to screen with a low opacity. This was just to give the image some texture.

		<br>⠀⠀⠀⠀This picture came from a project that I completed in class. The task given was to assemble 3 altered images in a single image, with a focus on using negative space and the gestalt theory. For the three images I chose a rose, an eye, and a sunset.
		<br>
		<br>⠀⠀⠀⠀For the image alterations, I started by tryin to align all of the pictures under a similar color scheme. I decided on using a tan background, which lead me to adjust everything to have a pastel color palette. I focused on making the rose look how I wanted, and then adjusted the sunset to match by assigning a color gradient to a grayscale version of the image. For the image of the eyeball, I focused using the gestalt theory because it is the middle photo and therefore the center of the piece. Additionally, I wanted to find a way to combine all three of the images. First, I combined the sunset and rose by using a layer mask of the rose over a red hued copy of the sunset. Finally, I included the eye by clearing a space in the layer mask and storing it in there. I feel that the final result reflects each element evenly. The sunset is present as the background, and the rose is present as the frame. Despite the relatively small size of the eye, I think that it is the most important part because it is not only the center of the middle image but the entire project as well.
